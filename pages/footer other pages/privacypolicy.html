Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if you visited the other website. These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website. Below you can find a list of the services we use:</p>

                <h3>Facebook</h3>
                <p>The Facebook page plugin is used to display our Facebook timeline on our site. Facebook has its own cookie and privacy policies over which we have no control. There is no installation of cookies from Facebook and your IP is not sent to a Facebook server until you consent to it. See their privacy policy here: Facebook Privacy Policy .</p>

                <h2>4. Cookies</h2>
                <p>This site uses cookies – small text files that are placed on your machine to help the site provide a better user experience. In general, cookies are used to retain user preferences, store information for things like shopping carts, and provide anonymised tracking data to third party applications like Google Analytics. Cookies generally exist to make your browsing experience better. However, you may prefer to disable cookies on this site and on others.

                <h2>5. Who Has Access To Your Data</h2>
                <p>If you are not a registered client for our site, there is no personal information we can retain or view regarding yourself.

                    If you are a client with a registered account, your personal information can be accessed by:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Our system administrators.</li>
                        <li>Our supporters when they (in order to provide support) need to get the information about the client accounts and access.</li>
                    </ul> </p>

                <h2>6. Third Party Access to Your Data</h2>

                <h2>7. How Long We Retain Your Data For</h2>
                <p>When you submit a support ticket or a comment, its metadata is retained until (if) you tell us to remove it. We use this data so that we can recognize you and approve your comments automatically instead of holding them for moderation.

                    If you register on our website, we also store the personal information you provide in your user profile. You can see, edit, or delete your personal information at any time (except changing your username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
                </p>

                <h2>8. Security Measures</h2>
                <p>We use the SSL/HTTPS protocol throughout our site. This encrypts our user communications with the servers so that personally identifiable information is not captured/hijacked by third parties without authorization.

                    In case of a data breach, system administrators will immediately take all needed steps to ensure system integrity, will contact affected users and will attempt to reset passwords if needed.</p>
